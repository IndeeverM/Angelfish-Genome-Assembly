# Angelfish-Genome-Assembly
This is a pipeline describing how I assembled the complete genome of the freshwater angelfish, Pterophylllum scalare.
A special thank you to Christopher Faulk (@dithiii) and his [pipeline](https://github.com/dithiii/ant-pipeline/blob/main/README.md) which greatly helped me in my work and inspired me to write this pipeline for those who are interested in alternative ways to assemble a genome or just specifically interested in how the angelfish genome was assembled.
